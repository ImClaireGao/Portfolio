            <p>The First Nations-led Primary Health Care Initiative is working to develop up to 15 Nations-led Primary Health Care Centres (FNPCCs) in rural and urban locations across BC. Our website is designed to showcase these centres through a cutting-edge medium, allowing the public to learn about the facilities without needing to visit in person. The goal is to encourage First Nations people to feel safe and respected when interacting with the services and visiting FNHA Primary Care Centres.</p>
